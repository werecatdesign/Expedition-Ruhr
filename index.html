                            <p>Expedition Ruhr is one of the expeditions that we organise. Our expeditions offer a unique, creative and also exciting way of exploring a new environment. We think that Expedition Ruhr is a great way to spend a fun and adventurous weekend weekend, getting to know new people, and gathering lots of new impression about the industrial, cultural and natural treasures that the Ruhr Area has to show.</p>

                            In January 2018, the Board of Directors of the Dutch oil corporation SeaStar N.V. decided to acquire one of its major competitors. In order to avoid a stock market crash, the upcoming acquisition which is planned to be carried out in September 2018 was declared highly confidential to those who were informed about it. However, one of the employees did not adhere to the confidentiality agreement and stole files that contain delicate corporate details about the upcoming deal.</p>

                            Katharina J. Engels, also known by her codename “Angel” in the underground scene, was born on the 2nd July 1989 in Essen, Germany. In 2010, she started her career as an IT specialist at SeaStar. In 2015, she got married to her former colleague and Dutch environmental activist Bram R. Alders who has been suspected of having connections to the anti-capitalist organisation Red European Resistance (RER). His current location is unknown.</p>

Your job as an agent is therefore to find her and to get the information about who has already received insight into the files.</p>
                        
                            <p><br>She has reportedly been seen in the Ruhr area around her hometown Essen during the last 24 hours. Your mission is to travel to the Ruhr Area and find Angel.

                        <p>
                            To most people, the Ruhr Area is primarily known for its history in coal mining and steel production. Mining was one of the central drivers of the industrialisation and economic growth in Germany. The mining industry also accounts for the urbanisation and geographical expansion of the Area, which includes cities like Cologne, Düsseldorf, Essen and many more.</p>
                            <p><br>
                            Due to structural changes, mining lost some of its importance in the 20th century, leading to many mining facilities being shut down. Many of these can still be visited today. Besides mining, the economy of the Ruhr Area mainly relies on the services sector.

                            Although known for its industry and cities, the Ruhr Area offers a lot of natural treasures. Even the name "Ruhr Area" has its origin in nature, as the area was named after its river Ruhr. In the area, there are 1,750 square kilometres of agricultural area and 800 square kilometres of forest, plus several lakes. Some of the forests have been left in their natural state for decades, offering untouched refuges for flora and fauna alike.</p>
                            <p><br>
                            Throughout the history of mining, man has made his very own contributions to shaping nature. Stones that were by-products of coal mining were disposed of in nature, forming the so-called "Halden", artificial hills of several 100 metres of height. The by-products of mining and naturally occuring metals in the soil have created habitats for rare plants and insects.

                            The culture of the Ruhr Area has majorly been shaped by mining. Working in a mine used to be a well-paid but rough job. Teamwork and communication were vital for the survival in the mines, and being a miner was a job to be proud of, since the mining industry was the backbone of the German economy. This history has shaped the area up until today. People of the Ruhr area are said to be very direct and honest, hard-working, communicative and social.</p>
                            <p><br>
                            For visitors, the Ruhr Area offers a lot of cultural attractions. A variety of museums invite visitors to learn about the history, visit abandoned factory buildings or enjoy arts and music. The Ruhr Area has over 200 museums, 3,500 industrial monuments, and 250 festivals and celebrations. It is a very vibrant and living area with a variety of things to discover!
